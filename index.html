            The dodo (Raphus cucullatus) is an extinct flightless bird that was endemic to the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. It was a member of the pigeon and dove family, Columbidae.

            The dodo became extinct in the late 17th century, and it is one of the most famous examples of human-induced extinction. The bird was large and flightless with a unique appearance, making it a subject of fascination and study.
